<h2>Knowledge so far</h2>
<p>I have good knowledge of front end development but, I lack knowledge in backend development.</p>

<h2>Expectations:</h2>
<p>
    My favourite mobile web application is <a href="https://slither.io/"><b>slither.io</b></a>. It is a webgl based game which could be played on any device with a simple internet connectivity and a browser installed.
    I have been playing since 2018. It has always been fun to play this game and works as a stress buster. Simple 2d graphics and super polished gameplay makes it perfect for casual gamers.

<h2>Expectations:</h2>
<p>
    What I expect from this course is that I want to learn how to develop a mobile web application which could serve as a platform where users can play and enjoy webgl games for free.
    Ever since, I started my career in game development I wanted to make such website for my webgl games and I think this course could provide me some essential knowledge and skills required to develop such websites.
